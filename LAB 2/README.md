# Problems

1. Write an ALP that finds the maximum number from a set of 32-bit numbers

2. Write an ALP to add 2 16-byte nos. using them
  1. as 16-bit data
  2. as 32-bit data

3. Write an ALP that will examine the contents of set of 10 bytes starting from location ‘ARRAY1’ for the presence of data ‘0AH’ and replace it with the ASCII character ‘E’.

4. Write an ALP that will count the number of negative numbers in an array of 16-bit signed data stored from location ‘ARRAY1’. The number of elements in the array is present in location ‘COUNT’. The count of negative numbers must be stored in location ‘NEG1’

5. Write an ALP that will transfer data from ‘ARRAY1’ to ‘ARRAY2’. The number of elements in the array is 10. The array is a double word array. The starting address of ARRAY2 = starting address of ARRAY1 + 20d .
